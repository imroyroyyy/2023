- [x] Introduce crew, at least loona unnie line, maybe more of them, captain Haseul (green), each wearing their respective color.
- [x] establish Jungeun’s attraction to Sooyoung, who arrives late to the meeting.
- [x] Haseul tells them there is an imposter, and to keep watch.

“We have at least one unauthorized personnel on board this ship,” Haseul says as she strolls into the cafeteria. She unlatches the clasp on her green suit, lifting the helmet to reveal her face, drawn with worry, bangs plastered to her forehead with sweat.
Jungeun looks around at the rest of the crew, all looking just as baffled as she is. She fiddles with her own helmet on her lap, clicking the latch on the neck absentmindedly as she studies their faces. She’d known these people for weeks. There was no way—
Jiwoo pipes up, eyes wide. “How do you know?” She looks scared, and Jungeun doesn’t blame her. She knows what had happened to Jiwoo’s mom—how she’d never come back from her own expedition. Jiwoo lived with her family after that. Jugeun scoots closer to Jiwoo. She was the only person she could trust. She knew Jiwoo. She was practically her sister.
Haseul nods at her. “We have unusually high radiation readings in the—”
“Hey guys, sorry.” Sooyoung jogs in, pulling her helmet off and shaking out her dark hair, pushing some of it out of her face and smearing her cheek with motor oil in the process. Jungeun blushes. How could someone be so attractive? “The lower engine had a loose bolt clanging around in it. Could have been really dangerous.”
Haseul nods and gestures for her to sit. “Not a problem.”
Sooyoung slides in next to Jungeun.
“As I was saying, there were unusually high radiation readings in the med bay early this week, and although the body scans are anonymized, we do know someone here isn’t who they say.” She looks each of them in the eye, and Jungeun glances around herself, wondering who here was who they said they were. “I wouldn’t normally make a crew-wide announcement about something like this, but we’re running a skeleton crew on this leg of the trip, so I need all eyes out for a potential imposter.”

Jinsol looks troubled after the meeting. “I don’t even know how a bolt could have gotten in there. We use rivets in the rear of the ship to prevent that kind of thing from happening.” Her eyes shift uneasily over to Jinsol before she remembers she’s talking to Jungeun. “Anyway, I’m sure it could have been knocking around in someone’s pocket.”

- [ ] Jungeun becoming more paraniod, having suspicious run-ins with everyone on the ship
//TODO [what secrets do each of them have that lead them to be so suspicious?]
- [ ] more suspicious run-ins with Sooyoung, admits that to Haseul, who asks her to keep an eye on sooyoung for her, she suspects her too.

Vivi is smuggling illegal cargo. Haseul wants to make an intermediate landing at a planet on the way to carry out a full investigation but Vivi refuses. (Reasoning, there is no ballast to get back up into space. It has been replaced with the contraband.) Jungeun catches her talking to the recipients in the comms room in hushed, rapid Cantonese. Vivi looks startled to see and and troubled when she realizes she has no idea how long Jungeun was there.

- [ ] Jungeun doesn’t have an alibi when **body #1** turns up and Sooyoung lies for her with no explanation, sending Jungeun into a tailspin.

- [ ] Haseul is barely holding it together.  she hasn’t cleaned the blood off the knees of her suit yet, “You need to catch her in the act, Jungeun. I can’t do anything without proof.”

- [ ] Sooyoung shows up in electrical from the cafeteria impossibly fast. Jungeun doesn’t see her on the way over.
- [ ] Sooyoung hastily stuffs a dirty rag into her back pocket when Jungeun joins her in the upper engine, clearly startled and not prepared for company. Emergency meeting called five minutes later. Another death, **body #2**.
- [ ] sooyoung: “you’re following me. why?”
- [ ] jungeun can’t even call it a lie when she admits she is attracted to sooyoung, they hook up.
- [ ] Jinsol accuses her of getting distracted. “Haseul told you to watch her, not fuck her.”
- [ ] jungeun: “why don’t you do it, then?”
- [ ] Jinsol is avoidant, “I have my own assignment.”
- [ ] Jiwoo is caught killing __body #3__, sent out of the airlock. Jungeun watches as her body bloats and explodes in the vaccum of space.
- [ ] body scans, there’s still an imposter on the ship. They wonder if they made a mistake, but no, they couldn’t have. Jiwoo wasn’t human when they’d found her standing over the corpse. There were two imposters.

---

- [ ] Haseul is destroyed in the wake of this. [plant hints that Jiwoo and Haseul might have been involved]. She doesn’t sleep. Just paces the ship. 
- [ ] Jungeun finds her hiding in storage when the lights go out, equal likelihood due to sabotage or their electrician being dead. 
- [ ] “I should have done something. It’s my fault.”
- [ ] Jungeun stares at her, slow realization creeping in, “Haseul did you…know that Jiwoo was—”
- [ ] Haseul stares up at her, eyes hollow. She doesn’t need to say anything at all.
- [ ] The next day, she silently passes her captain’s rank to Vivi.

Sooyoung scrambles back after Jungeun removes her helmet. “You’re not Jungeun.”

Jungeun steps towards her, eyes zeroing in on Sooyoung’s neck, pulse clear and rapid under her skin. “Yes, I am.”
