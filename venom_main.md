- [x] Introduce crew, at least loona unnie line, maybe more of them, captain Haseul (green), each wearing their respective color.
- [x] establish Jungeun’s attraction to Sooyoung, who arrives late to the meeting.
- [x] Haseul tells them there is an imposter, and to keep watch.
- [ ] Heejin is found dead in electrical during the shift change. Everyone is called for an emergency meeting.

Jungeun wakes up in a panic at the sound of the siren before being blinded by the flashing red light right above her bed. She covers her ears and squeezes her eyes shut, trying to orient herself. She pats around the table next to her bunk for her glasses and slips them on before standing, covering her ears again when the siren gets louder.

She dons her suit, as per protocol. Emergency meetings usually meant a breach somewhere in the hull. All hands on deck was necessary in those cases.

The siren is muffled by her helmet and Jugeun allows herself to relax as the sound fades from ugent to bearable. She triple checks the seals on her gloves and helmet before she presses the button to open the door to her room.

Once she's outside, she's met by a puzzled-looking Hyunjin, who hasn't bothered to put her helmet on. She rubs her eyes and frowns at Jungeun. "Have any clue what this is about?"

Jungeun shrugs, still getting her own bearings.

They make their way to the cafeteria together, where Haseul paces in front of the table where everyonce else has gathered. No one else seems to know what's happening except Jinsol, who's frozen, eyes fixed on some imaginary point in the distance. She jumps when Hyunjin knocks into her as she slides onto the bench.

"What's up?" Jungeun asks.

Jinsol just shakes her head.

Haseul clears her throat and the uneasy muttering around the table stops. 

"I didn't think this would happen," She starts quietly, fiddling with the latch on her green suit, before she looks up at the crew and visibly steels herself, straightening her shoulders, and that's when Jungeun knows something bad has happened. "There's no easy way to say this. One of your crewmates was found dead this morning during electrical shift change."

It takes a second to sink in, and then Jungeun watches Hyunjin fall to the floor, face slack with grief and horror. She sobs once, tight and horrible before she looks up at Haseul. "Let me see her."

Haseul shakes her head. "It's best for everyone if no one sees." 

Jungeun knows what that means. Everyone on board the ship does. Her helmet is suddenly suffocating. She undoes the latch and drops her helmet into her lap, where the chrome detailing reflects the brilliant red of her suit. She fiddles the latch on the helmet absentmindedly as she studies the other crew member's faces. She’d known these people for weeks. There was no way—

Haseul doesn't need to explain. "Please be vigilant for anything suspicious. If you see or hear anything that seems out of the ordinary, don't wait to report it. This button is here for a reason." She gestures to the bright red button under the plastic cover in the center of the table. "It would be easy for us to let this divide us, but that's not an option, especially since we're a skeleton crew on this leg of the mission. Let's wait it out until the next docking station where we can do a proper search using security personnel from the station."

Jungeun feels faint, and the skin on the back of her neck prickles. She feels watched. Like she could be the next target. She looks around at the rest of the crew. Jiwoo looks scared, and Jungeun doesn’t blame her. She knows what had happened to Jiwoo’s mom—how the company had said there wasn't enough to scrape off the walls to justify sending a box home. Jiwoo had lived with her family after that. Jugeun scoots closer to Jiwoo. She was the only person she could trust. She *knew* Jiwoo. She was practically her sister.

Then she's startles by the hydraulic hiss of the door from the engines. “Hey guys, sorry.” Sooyoung jogs in, pulling her helmet off and shaking out her dark hair, pushing some of it out of her face and smearing her cheek with motor oil in the process. It compliments her cheekbones, and Jungeun averts her eyes. Not the time. “The lower engine had a loose bolt clanging around in it. Could have been really dangerous.”

Haseul gestures for her to sit. “There's been a death.”

Sooyoung sinks into the nearest chair, eyes wide. "What? Who?"

"Heejin. Last night. It's," Haseul glances at everyone. No one likes the word. Jungeun knows Haseul doesn't want to say it. She doesn't have to. Maybe it's better she doesn't.

Sooyoung nods, face grim. "I'll keep an eye out."

Haseul swallows. Shaking her head slowly. "We can make it to the station. Continue your tasks. I know it's going to be hard, but it's how we get there."

Jungeun kneels down next to Hyunjin after the meeting, resting a hand on her shoulder. "Can I help you stand?"

Jinsol watches the two of them from her seat at the table. She looks troubled. "Maybe get her an IV."

Hyunjin's eyes light up. "Yes, I think that's what—"

Vivi interrupts. "No. You're not permitted in the medbay until we've—" she clears her throat. There's no polite way to say 'dealt with the viscera.'

Jungeun feels Hyunjin's muscles coil, and that's how she knows to tighten her grip on her before Hyunjin can lunge at Vivi.

"Let me see her! I need to say goodbye!" Jungeun doesn't know if she's ever heard Hyunjin so emotional, her voice rough and choked up. Jungeun can hear the way she has to force the words out.

"Vivi," Jungeun starts. Maybe it *could* help—

"No." Vivi shakes her head. Then, softly, "Trust me."

Vivi turns away after that, and slinks out of the room quietly.

Junguen relaxes her grip on Hyunjin, who slumps against Jungeun before finding her legs. "I need to clear her bunk. She needs," Hyunjin shrugs. "Her family should be sent something at least."

Jungeun nods. It's not her place. She hadn't known the two of them for long, but Heejin and Hyunjin had...orbited each other.

Jinsol speaks up when it's just the two of them left. “We use rivets in the rear of the ship to prevent bolts from coming loose in the engine.” Her eyes shift uneasily over to Sooyoung's helmet, forgotten on the table, before she remembers she’s talking to Jungeun. “Anyway, I’m sure it could have been knocking around in someone’s pocket.”

---

The atmosphere of the ship changes. Of course it does. This was supposed to be a straighforward supply mission

- [ ] Jungeun becoming more paraniod, having suspicious run-ins with everyone on the ship

//FIXME what secrets do each of them have that lead them to be so suspicious?

---

Hyunjin

Haseul isn't where she's stationed when Junguen goes to look for her, evasive when Jungeun asks her where she was.

Vivi is smuggling illegal cargo. Haseul wants to make an intermediate landing at a planet on the way to carry out a full investigation but Vivi refuses. (Reasoning, there is no ballast to get back up into space. It has been replaced with the contraband.) Jungeun catches her talking to the recipients in the comms room in hushed, rapid Cantonese. Vivi looks startled to see her, and troubled when she realizes she has no idea how long Jungeun was there.

Jinsol is fudging the inventory numbers 

Sooyoung

Jiwoo always seems to find Jungeun before Jungeun can find her.

Chaewon

- Being in an area where they don't belong: "I was lost and trying to find my way back to my quarters"
- Being alone and not responding to communication attempts: "I was in the shower and couldn't hear my device"
- Being near a victim's body without a logical reason: "I found the body while investigating a noise I heard"
- Being nervous or acting suspiciously: "I was just anxious because I didn't want to be voted out"
- Suddenly changing their story or alibi: "I must have misspoke earlier, I remember now I was in the engine room"
- Being in possession of stolen items: "I found this item lying around and picked it up"
- Having a different color than the rest of the crew: "I just changed my appearance for fun"
- Being seen on security cameras in the vicinity of a murder: "I was just passing by, I didn't see anything suspicious"
- Showing contradictory behavior: "I'm naturally a calm person, I didn't know how else to react in that situation"

- [ ] Jungeun doesn’t have an alibi when **body #2** turns up and Sooyoung lies for her with no explanation, sending Jungeun into a tailspin.

- [ ] Haseul is barely holding it together.  she hasn’t cleaned the blood off the knees of her suit yet, “You need to catch her in the act, Jungeun. I can’t do anything without proof.”

- [ ] Sooyoung shows up in electrical from the cafeteria impossibly fast. Jungeun doesn’t see her on the way over.
- [ ] Sooyoung hastily stuffs a dirty rag into her back pocket when Jungeun joins her in the upper engine, clearly startled and not prepared for company.
- [ ] sooyoung: “you’re following me. why?”
- [ ] jungeun can’t even call it a lie when she admits she is attracted to sooyoung, they hook up.
- [ ] affair continues
- [ ] Jinsol accuses her of getting distracted. “Haseul told you to watch her, not fuck her.”
- [ ] jungeun: “why don’t you do it, then?”
- [ ] Jinsol is avoidant, “I have my own assignment.”
- [ ] Jiwoo is caught killing **body #3**, sent out of the airlock. Jungeun watches as her body bloats and explodes in the vaccum of space.
- [ ] body scans, there’s still an imposter on the ship. They wonder if they made a mistake, but no, they couldn’t have. Jiwoo wasn’t human when they’d found her standing over the corpse. There were two imposters.
- [ ] Jungeun ill with stress, goes to sooyoung's bunk to decompress

---

- [ ] Haseul is destroyed in the wake of this. [plant hints that Jiwoo and Haseul might have been involved]. She doesn’t sleep. Just paces the ship. 
- [ ] Jungeun finds her hiding in storage when the lights go out, equal likelihood due to sabotage or their electrician being dead. 
- [ ] “I should have done something. It’s my fault.”
- [ ] Jungeun stares at her, slow realization creeping in, “Haseul did you…know that Jiwoo was—”
- [ ] Haseul stares up at her, eyes hollow. She doesn’t need to say anything at all.
- [ ] The next day, she silently passes her captain’s rank to Vivi.

//TODO more plot here

- [ ] sooyoung corners her, jungeun thinks she looks weird. they hook up anyway

Jungeun could lie to herself—claim she doesn't care how dangerous Sooyoung might be, doesn't care that every time they meet she could be inches from death—but the truth is worse. She knows it by the crawling heat beneath her skin. Sooyoung's danger makes it better.

- [ ] Jungeun falling for Sooyoung, defending her when haseul wants to send her out of the airlock.
- [ ] Haseul confronting her afterwards. "You know it's her just as much as I do."

- [ ] **body #4** is discovered. Jungeun doesn't have a chance of denying it's her. Sooyoung catches her with blood on her hands.

Sooyoung scrambles back after Jungeun removes her helmet. “You’re not Jungeun.”

Jungeun steps towards her, eyes zeroing in on Sooyoung’s neck, pulse clear and rapid under her skin. “Yes, I am.”

//FIXME Figure out exact ending. Jungeun sent out of airlock.
